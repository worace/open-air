## OpenAir

Since the [[http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/20/9772784/rdio-shutdown-free-tier-pandora-acquisition][shutdown of Rdio]], this library is sadly diminished in utility.

While Rdio was around, this project would run a daemon that regularly scraped the public playlist of Colorado Public Radio's [[http://www.cpr.org/openair/playlist][Open Air]] new music station and added its tracks to an Rdio playlist for that date. This way you could check out, for example "Open Air Playlist: June 25, 2015" and listen to any of the tracks Open Air had played that day which were also available on Rdio.

RIP Rdio, was fun while it lasted.

Obvious big TODO: port the playlist construction logic to Spotify.
